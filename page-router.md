### How file/page based routing works
#### Below is the example of file strucutre in next js and how we can access these routes 
- /pages
  - index.js  ----> we can access it using mydomain.com
  - about.js  ---->  mydomain.com/about
  - /products
    - index.js  ----> mydomain.com/products
    - [id].js   ----> mydomain.com/products/1, mydomain.com/products/2.....mydomain.com/products/n
